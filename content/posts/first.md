## Interests

I was a Ballet dancer for 7 years and a martial artist for 10. I am a member of the Cape Fear Makers Guild–a club comprised of local engineers and artists–and I have a fascination with engineering, 3d printing, and woodworking. I am working towards designing and building my own house.
